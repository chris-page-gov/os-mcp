# Ordnance Survey MCP Server

A MCP server for accessing UK geospatial data through Ordnance Survey APIs.

## What it does

Provides LLM access to the Ordnance Survey's Data Hub APIs. 

Ask simple questions such as find me all cinemas in Leeds City Centre or use the prompts templates for more complex, speciifc use cases - relating to street works, planning, etc.

This MCP server enforces a 2 step workflow plan to ensure that the user gets the best results possible.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get an OS API Key

Register at [OS Data Hub](https://osdatahub.os.uk/) to get your free API key and set up a project.

### 2. Run with Docker and add to your Claude Desktop config (easiest)

```bash
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/os-mcp-server.git
cd os-mcp-server
```

Then build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t os-mcp-server .
```

Add the following to your Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "os-mcp-server": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e",
        "OS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here",
        "-e",
        "STDIO_KEY=any_value",
        "os-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Open Claude Desktop and you should now see all available tools, resources, and prompts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- OS API Key from [OS Data Hub](https://osdatahub.os.uk/)
- Set a STDIO_KEY env var which can be any value for now whilst auth is improved.
